# City Year Python Library

Welcome!  This is a home for coding projects which are being developed by members of the City Year Python Community. A current primary focus is web automation.  Many tasks that are given to impact points involve needless amounts of repetitive activity on SalesForce or in other contexts.  Using tools like Selenium we can automate many of these tasks.  Our goal is to create wrappers which allows a user to pass in some parameters in the form of a csv, and have Selenium create sections, enroll students, and make focus list changes based on that.

## How to contribute!

The easiest way to get started is to dive into the code, and when you find something that doesn't make sense post an issue!  If you keep getting an error when you're running the code, post an issue!  This doesn't require any coding beyond trying to get the scripts to run.  

For those who want to start contributing code, its time to fork the project.  If you need help understanding how to do this, get in touch with me at aperusse@cityyear.org!
