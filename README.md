## How to contribute!

The easiest way to get started is to dive into the code, and when you find something that doesn't make sense post an issue!  If you keep getting an error when you're running the code, post an issue!  This doesn't require any coding beyond trying to get the scripts to run.  

For those who want to start contributing code, its time to fork the project.  If you need help understanding how to do this, get in touch with me!  We'll do a short tutorial during one of our check ins a little later in the year.
