# cyschoolhouse Automater

These scripts are used to automate the filling of forms and downloading of data from cyschoolhouse. 

## Dependencies
The main dependencies are [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and 
[selenium-requests](https://github.com/cryzed/Selenium-Requests) which are available via pip.  Make sure to follow the 
Selenium install instruction carefully, particularly in making sure that you have the appropriate driver for the browser 
you would like to use. The current scripts expect you to use Firefox, which uses the 
[gecko driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Besides that, all other packages used are a part of the python core.
